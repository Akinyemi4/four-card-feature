## My process

- I begin with the HTML as usual then proceed to CSS to style it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Here, i learnt a lot in this challenge as regards layouts and its setting.
- I learnt how to use a major css property "align-self"

### Continued development

- I think with the projects done so far I now understand firmly the use of CSS grid and how powerful it's so I'll like to work more on building landing pages and more complex components.
